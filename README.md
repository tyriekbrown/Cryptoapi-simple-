# Cryptoapi-simple-
Working on this with crypto currancy in mind. User can enter a coin and get the current price of that coin. functions great but still not complete.
My Awesome Project

This API gets prices on bit coins and much more under the crypto status. this helps keep up with worth of coin.
Lessons Learned: There are a lot of different coins to choose from.
